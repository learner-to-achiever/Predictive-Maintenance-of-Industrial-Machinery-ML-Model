# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machinery-ML-Model (IBM internship)
Capstone-Project-Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery ML Model
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial machines to anticipate failures before they occur. This project will involve analyzing sensor data from machinery to identify patterns that precede a failure. The goal is to create a classification model that can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on real-time operational data. This will enable proactive maintenance, reducing downtime and operational costs. Technology â€“ Use of IBM cloud lite services.
